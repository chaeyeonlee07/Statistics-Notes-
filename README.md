  ◻️ Lecture 21: Shrinkage Method Rasso Regression
  
    🟦 Summary: We can lower MSE by inducing bias while lowering variances. Two methods are Lasso and Ridge. Ridge is two squared norms on each beta coefficients. Larger lambda leads to smaller $\beta$, smaller variance of $\beta$, and more biased $\beta$. There is always some value of lambda such that the MSE of ridge estimator is lower than that of OLS, although such parameter $\lambda$ is unknown.
